# Convolutional-Composer-Classification
The machine learning models and the framework used in paper "Convolutional Composer Classification" can be found here.

To run the models you will need python3 and jupyter notebook.
Luckily installing Anaconda installs both, and it also allows us to create python environments! 

We can install anaconda FOR PYTHON 3 using link https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.

Once anaconda is installed, we can create and enter a python environment like so :
```
conda create -n myenv python=3.6 
```
Make sure you replace `3.6` by your python 3 version.
